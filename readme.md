# Memory Match Game

Welcome to the Memory Match Game! This simple Java console application challenges you to match pairs of cards and reveal the hidden characters underneath. Can you remember where the matching cards are?

## How to Play

1. Run the `Main` class in your Java environment.
2. You will be presented with a board of 20 cards, each represented by an underscore `_`.
3. The cards contain numbers from 1 to 10, and each number has a matching pair.
4. Your goal is to find all the matching pairs by guessing the position of the cards.
5. Enter two guesses (positions) when prompted, and the game will reveal whether the cards at those positions match.
6. If the cards match, their corresponding positions on the board will be updated with the matching numbers.
7. The game continues until all pairs have been successfully matched.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Compile and run the `Main` class.
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   java Main
   ```

## Rules

- You have a total of 10 attempts to match all pairs.
- Input your guesses as positions on the board (1-20).
- The game will only consider valid moves, and incorrect guesses will not affect your remaining attempts.

## Good Luck!
